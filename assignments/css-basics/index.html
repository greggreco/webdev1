            <p>Capybara's are superb swimmers. They can hold their breath for up to 5 minutes at a time! Wow! While they're agile on land, they're equally adept navigating waters. They use their swimming abilities to evade predators. They also love wallowing in the mud! </p>

            <p>Capybara's are gregarious creatures and establish many social bonds. Groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals which gather around available water sources with other animals. They can make dog-like barks when threatened!</p>
